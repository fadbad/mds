## Onboarding Process (India-Specific)

### Step 1: Initial Contact (First 5 Minutes)

**Positioning in India:**
```
"Squidway is like the Kerala State Lottery or Sikkim Lottery, but:
- Runs on blockchain (100% transparent, verifiable)
- Uses cryptocurrency (USDT - stable, always ₹80-85 per USDT)
- Instant prize payouts (no claim forms, no delays)
- Global participation

As an agent, you earn commission every time someone buys a ticket through your link."
```

**Key phrases that work in India:**
- "Side income" (not "passive income" - sounds lazy)
- "Work from home" (post-COVID normalization)
- "No investment required" (critical for trust)
- "Performance-based" (Indians respect merit)
- "Like Amway/Tupperware but digital" (network marketing familiar)

---

### Step 2: Address Crypto Concerns

**Common Indian objections:**

**1. "Main crypto nahi jaanta" (I don't know crypto)**
```
Response:
"No problem! Crypto sikhana hamari responsibility hai.

Aapko bas 3 cheezein seekhni hai:
1. Wallet kaise banate hain (5 minutes)
2. USDT kaise khareedte hain (UPI se easy)
3. USDT kaise receive karte hain (automatic)

Baaki sab automated hai. Training videos bhi hai Hindi mein."
```

**2. "Crypto risky hai, scam hai" (Crypto is risky/scam)**
```
Response:
"Valid concern! But understand:

USDT = Stablecoin
It always equals ₹80-85 (1 US Dollar)
Price doesn't go up/down like Bitcoin

Squidway uses blockchain = everything is transparent
You can verify every draw on blockchain
No one can cheat (not even us!)

Lakhs of Indians already use USDT safely."
```

**3. "Government ban karega kya?" (Will government ban it?)**
```
Response:
"Crypto is legal in India:
- Supreme Court lifted RBI ban in 2020
- 30% tax on crypto (so it's recognized)
- WazirX, CoinDCX operate legally
- 100 million Indians use crypto

Squidway operates globally, accessible to Indians.
We're not violating any law."
```

**4. "Yeh pyramid scheme hai kya?" (Is this pyramid scheme?)**
```
Response:
"Bilkul nahi! Clear difference:

Pyramid scheme = You earn by recruiting people
Squidway = You earn from actual ticket sales

Like:
- Insurance agent earns from policy sales
- Amway distributor earns from product sales
- You earn from ticket sales

Commission structure is transparent, no hidden levels."
```

---

### Step 3: Wallet Setup (Critical in India!)

**Recommended wallets for Indians:**

**1. WazirX Wallet (Easiest for Indians)**
- Pros: Indian company, INR deposits, KYC easy
- Cons: Centralized, less "true crypto"
- Best for: Complete beginners

**2. Trust Wallet (Recommended)**
- Pros: Easy to use, popular globally, good support
- Cons: Need to understand private keys
- Best for: Most agents

**3. MetaMask (Power users)**
- Pros: Most compatible, web3 standard
- Cons: Slightly technical
- Best for: Tech-savvy agents

**Provide:**
- Video tutorial (English + Hindi)
- Step-by-step PDF guide
- Telegram support group for queries
- WhatsApp number for urgent help
- Screen-share support if needed

**Common wallet setup issues in India:**
- Phone number verification (use Indian number)

- SMS OTP delays (network issues)
- Storage space (cheap phones)

---

### Step 4: USDT Acquisition (Make it EASY)

**Best methods for Indians:**

```

**Option 2: CoinDCX**
```
Similar to WazirX:
1. App download + KYC
2. Deposit INR via UPI
3. Buy USDT
4. Withdraw to wallet
```

**Option 3: P2P Trading (No KYC)**
```
For those without documents:
1. Join P2P Telegram groups
2. Find verified sellers
3. Send INR via UPI/PhonePe/Paytm
4. Receive USDT to wallet
5. Slightly higher price but no KYC
```

---

## Legal & Compliance (Indian Context)

### Important Considerations:

**1. Crypto Legal Status:**
```
Current Status (2026):
✅ Cryptocurrencies are LEGAL in India
✅ 30% tax + 1% TDS on transactions
✅ Must declare in ITR
✅ Exchanges operate with registration
✅ Supreme Court removed RBI ban (2020)
```

**2. Gambling & Lottery Laws:**
```
Complex State-by-State:
- 13 states have government lotteries (Kerala, Maharashtra, Punjab, etc.)
- Online lottery/gambling = grey area
- Games of skill (rummy) legal, games of chance (lottery) complex
- Position as "global platform accessible to Indians"
```

**3. Tax Implications:**
```
For Agents:
- Commission = income (30% crypto tax)
- Must file ITR-2 or ITR-3
- TDS deducted automatically
- Maintain transaction records

Educate agents on:
- How to report crypto income
- Documentation needed
- Tax saving strategies
```

**4. Disclosure Requirements:**
```
Every communication must include:
- "18+ only" (in English + Hindi: "केवल 18+ के लिए")
- "Crypto subject to 30% tax" disclosure
- "Play responsibly" message
- "जिम्मेदारी से खेलें"
```

**5. KYC/AML:**
```
Follow exchange norms:
- Aadhaar verification
- PAN mandatory (for tax)
- Address proof
- Selfie verification
```

## Cultural Nuances for India

### Do's:
✅ Use "₹" rupee symbol (not just USD)
✅ Reference Indian festivals (Diwali bonus, Holi sale)
✅ Show respect for family (family income, ₹10K helps family)
✅ Use Hinglish (code-switching natural)
✅ Cricket references work (T20 of lotteries)
✅ Value for money messaging (₹5 ticket, ₹50 lakh prize)
✅ Educational tone (Indians value learning)
✅ Success stories with photos (social proof)

### Don'ts:
❌ Don't be too pushy (Indians value relationships)
❌ Avoid "get rich quick" (sounds scammy)
❌ Don't ignore regional differences (Mumbai ≠ Chennai)
❌ Don't assume crypto knowledge (educate first)
❌ Don't skip the "why blockchain matters" (transparency valued)
❌ Avoid beef/pork references (religious sensitivity)
❌ Don't forget regional language importance

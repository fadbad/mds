# Email Strategy for @qoqsik1 Collaboration

## Situation Analysis

**What we know:**
- Big streamer: 3M+ followers
- Open to collaboration ("email me to discuss")
- NOT interested in referral models
- Likely receives many partnership offers

**What this means:**
- She wants a more traditional sponsorship deal
- Referral/performance models may feel too "MLM-ish" to her
- She probably prefers flat fees or guaranteed compensation
- She values her reputation and won't risk it on commission-only

---

## Recommended Approach

**Offer a HYBRID model:**
1. **Guaranteed flat fee** (upfront or per post/stream)
2. **Performance bonus** (optional, on top of flat fee)
3. **Custom package** based on her audience size

**This positions Squidway as:**
- Professional and legitimate
- Respectful of her value
- Flexible and collaborative
- Not just another affiliate program

## Email Template: Version 1 (Professional + Flexible)

**Subject:** Re: Collaboration with Squidway - Sponsorship Proposal

---

Hi [Her Name],

Thanks for getting back to us! Totally understand the referral model isn't your thing – we'd love to discuss a more traditional sponsorship instead.

**Quick context:** Squidway is a blockchain lottery platform with fully transparent, provably-fair draws. We're looking for a flagship partnership with a creator of your caliber.

**What we're proposing:**

Instead of the standard ELITE program, we'd like to offer you a custom sponsorship package:

**Option 1: Flat Fee Partnership**
• $5,000 per sponsored post/stream segment
• 3-post minimum ($15K total)
• Full creative control
• We provide talking points, you make it authentic

**Option 2: Hybrid Model**
• $3,000 per post guaranteed
• PLUS performance bonus (up to $2K per post based on signups)
• Best of both worlds - guaranteed income + upside

**Option 3: Campaign Partnership**
• $20,000 for a 1-month campaign
• 4-6 posts/mentions across your channels
• Custom landing page with your branding
• Exclusive promo code for your audience

**What you'd promote:**
- Transparent blockchain lottery (all draws verifiable on-chain)
- 5M USDT grand prize
- Beginner-friendly (we handle the "how to" for crypto newcomers)

We're flexible on structure, content format, and timing. Happy to adjust to what works best for your audience and brand.

Would love to hop on a quick call to discuss, or we can continue via email if you prefer.

Let me know what sounds interesting!

Best,
[Your Name]

## Email Template: Version 2 (Direct + Value-Focused)

**Subject:** Custom Partnership Proposal - Squidway x [Her Handle]

---

Hi [Her Name],

Thanks for being open to discussing a collaboration!

I completely understand not wanting a referral model – we'd like to offer you something better suited to a creator with 3M+ followers.

**Custom Sponsorship Package:**

We're proposing **$25,000** for a flagship partnership campaign:

• 1-month partnership (your choice of format: streams, posts, stories)
• Guaranteed payment (no performance requirements)
• Full creative control
• Custom promo code with your branding
• Option to extend if it resonates with your audience

**What makes Squidway different:**
Unlike traditional lotteries, everything we do is on the blockchain - provably fair, instantly verifiable, automatic payouts. We're basically bringing transparency to an industry that's historically been opaque.

**Your audience fit:**
Given your gaming/streaming background, your audience likely understands or is curious about crypto, making this a natural fit.

**Next steps:**
If the range works for you, I can send over a detailed proposal with content examples, timeline, and payment structure.

Would you prefer to discuss over email or hop on a quick 15-min call?

Looking forward to working together!

**Why this works:**
✅ Leads with a strong offer ($25K)
✅ Removes performance pressure
✅ Explains product value clearly
✅ Acknowledges her audience fit
✅ Gives her control over next steps

## Email Template: Version 3 (Consultation Approach)

**Subject:** Let's Build Something Custom - Squidway Partnership

---

Hey [Her Name],

Appreciate you being open to chat about this!

You're right to pass on the standard referral model – with 3M+ followers, you deserve better than a commission-only structure.

**Here's what I'm thinking:**

Rather than pitching you a pre-built package, I'd like to understand what type of partnerships typically work best for you and your audience, then build something custom around that.

**A few questions to start:**
1. What partnership structures have worked well for you in the past?
2. Typical rate range for sponsored content on your channels?
3. Any specific types of products/services you prefer (or avoid)?
4. How hands-on do you like brands to be with content creation?

**About Squidway in 30 seconds:**
We're a blockchain lottery platform (think Powerball meets Ethereum). Everything's transparent and verifiable on-chain. We're targeting crypto-curious audiences, which overlaps nicely with gaming/streaming communities.

**Budget-wise:** We're flexible and prepared to pay fair market rates for your reach. Thinking in the $15K-30K range depending on scope, but happy to discuss.

Let me know your thoughts, and we can build something that makes sense for both sides.

Cheers,
[Your Name]

**Why this works:**
✅ Consultative (not sales-y)
✅ Asks her what she wants (collaborative)
✅ Shows budget flexibility
✅ Respects her expertise
✅ Positions her as partner, not just influencer

## MY RECOMMENDATION: Use Version 2

**Why Version 2 is best:**
1. **Strong opening** - Leads with $25K (shows you're serious)
2. **Addresses her concern** - Guaranteed payment, no referral BS
3. **Right length** - Not too long, not too short
4. **Clear next steps** - Makes it easy for her to say yes
5. **Professional** - Matches her level

**Suggested pricing based on her size:**

**For 3M+ followers:**
- Single post: $5,000-8,000
- Story series (3-5 stories): $3,000-5,000
- Stream integration (15-20 min): $8,000-12,000
- Monthly campaign (multiple touchpoints): $20,000-40,000

**She likely expects:**
- $3-10 CPM (cost per thousand followers)
- 3M followers = $9,000-30,000 for a campaign
- Higher if she has strong engagement

---

## Alternative Offer: Exclusive Ambassador

If budget is tight, offer this:

**"Exclusive Gaming Ambassador"**
- $15,000 guaranteed for 3 months
- Be THE face of Squidway in gaming/streaming space
- 1 main post per month + organic mentions
- Custom landing page: squidway.io/qoqsik
- Bonus pool: Extra $5K if campaign performs exceptionally

**Framing:**
"We're looking for one flagship creator to be the face of Squidway in the gaming space, not 100 affiliates. We think that's you."

---

## What NOT to Do

❌ **Don't:**
- Lowball her ($1-2K won't work for 3M followers)
- Push the referral model again
- Make it complicated
- Require too many deliverables
- Be vague about compensation
- Take too long to respond
- Send a generic template

✅ **Do:**
- Offer real money ($15K+ minimum)
- Be clear and direct
- Give her creative control
- Respond quickly (within 24 hours)
- Be flexible on content format
- Respect her time

---

## Negotiation Strategy

**If she says your offer is too low:**
```
"Thanks for the feedback! What range were you thinking? 
We want to be fair and make sure this is worth your time."
```

**If she asks for more details first:**
```
"Happy to provide more info! What specifically would be helpful - 
product details, content examples, or campaign structure?"
```

**If she's interested but busy:**
```
"No rush! When would be a good time to continue this conversation? 
Happy to work around your schedule."
```

**If she wants a call:**
```
"Perfect! I'm available [give 2-3 specific time options]. 
Does any of those work for you?"
```

---

## Follow-Up Timeline

**If no response in:**
- 3 days: Send friendly bump
- 1 week: Send final follow-up
- 2 weeks: Move on (she's not interested)

**Bump email (after 3 days):**
```
Subject: Re: Custom Partnership Proposal

Hey [Her Name],

Just wanted to bump this to the top of your inbox! 

Still very interested in working together on a custom sponsorship 
package (guaranteed payment, no referral stuff).

Let me know if you have any questions or if now's not the right time.

[Your Name]
```

## Content Examples to Include (If She Asks)

**For a streamer, suggest:**

**Option A: Natural Integration**
"During stream, play a few lottery rounds on screen, explain how the blockchain verification works, show the transparent draw process. 15-20 minutes total."

**Option B: Dedicated Segment**
"Start of stream: 'Today's stream is brought to you by Squidway, let me show you why this is different from traditional lotteries...'"

**Option C: Giveaway Integration**
"Use Squidway as part of a community giveaway: 'I'm buying 100 tickets and if any of them win, we're splitting it with 10 random viewers!'"

**All with your authentic voice, obviously - we just provide the key points.**

---

## Deal Structure Options

**Payment Structure A: All Upfront**
- $25,000 paid before first post
- Pros: She gets paid immediately
- Cons: Risk for you if she doesn't deliver

**Payment Structure B: Split**
- $12,500 upon contract signing
- $12,500 upon campaign completion
- Pros: Balanced risk
- Cons: More administrative work

**Payment Structure C: Per Deliverable**
- $8,000 per major post/stream
- 3 posts = $24,000 total
- Pros: Tied to deliverables
- Cons: More complex tracking

**Recommendation:** Use Structure B (split payment)

---

## Contract Points to Include

**If she agrees, your contract should specify:**
- Total compensation amount
- Number of posts/streams required
- Timeline (start and end dates)
- Content approval process (if any)
- FTC disclosure requirements (#ad, #sponsored)
- Exclusivity clause (can't promote competing lotteries for X months)
- Payment terms (net 30, crypto or fiat, etc.)
- Content ownership (she owns her content, you can repost)

---

## ROI Calculation (For Your Internal Decision)

**If you pay her $25,000:**

**Conservative scenario (0.1% conversion):**
- 3M followers × 0.1% = 3,000 people check it out
- 1% buy tickets = 30 active users
- 30 users × 2 tickets avg = 60 tickets = $300 revenue
- **ROI: -$24,700 (loss)**

**Realistic scenario (0.3% conversion):**
- 3M followers × 0.3% = 9,000 people check it out
- 2% buy tickets = 180 active users
- 180 users × 2 tickets = 360 tickets = $1,800 revenue
- **ROI: -$23,200 (still loss, but brand awareness gain)**

**Optimistic scenario (1% conversion):**
- 3M followers × 1% = 30,000 people check it out
- 3% buy tickets = 900 active users
- 900 users × 3 tickets = 2,700 tickets = $13,500 revenue
- **Long-term value:** These users continue playing
- **ROI: -$11,500 first month, but potential LTV of $50-100 per user**

**Real ROI:**
- Brand awareness (3M+ impressions)
- Social proof (if she likes it, others will try)
- Content you can reuse in marketing
- Potential for her organic continued promotion

**This is a brand play, not a direct ROI play.**

---

## Final Recommendation

**Send Version 2 email with these terms:**

**Offer:**
- $25,000 for 1-month campaign
- 4-6 pieces of content (her choice of format)
- Guaranteed payment (50% upfront, 50% on completion)
- Full creative control
- Custom promo code
- Optional: Bonus $5K if campaign exceeds expectations

**Timeline:**
- Respond within 24 hours
- If interested, move to contract within 1 week
- Launch campaign within 2-4 weeks

**Mindset:**
- This is a flagship partnership, not a typical affiliate
- You're buying brand awareness + social proof, not just conversions
- Her 3M followers are worth the investment for legitimacy

**Decision point:**
If she counters at $30-40K, decide if the brand value is worth it. If she counters at $50K+, politely decline and say budget doesn't allow, but you'd love to revisit in 6 months when you've grown.

Good luck! This could be a game-changer for Squidway's credibility. 🚀

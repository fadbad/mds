---

## Response Handling

### If they ask "How realistic is 500 active users?"
```
Great question! 

500 active users = 500 people who buy at least one ticket (5 USDT each).

With your [follower count] followers and our marketing toolkit, it's definitely achievable. Most successful SQUIDERs hit this milestone in 2-4 months.

You earn 2.5 USDT per ticket immediately though - the 5K is just a bonus on top!
```

### If they ask "What's the catch?"
```
No catch! It's pure performance-based.

You earn commissions immediately from day 1. The 5K bonus is just an extra incentive to help us grow the platform together.

Only requirement: 1K+ followers and comfort promoting crypto/gaming content.
```

### If they ask "What if I don't hit 500 users?"
```
You still keep ALL your commissions! 

The 5K is a bonus milestone, not a requirement. Even if you bring 10 active users, you earn 25 USDT (2.5 per ticket) + potential 10% of their winnings.

No minimums, no quotas - just ongoing passive income.
```

### If they ask "How do you track active users?"
```
Your dashboard shows everything in real-time:
• Total referrals
• Active users (purchased at least 1 ticket)
• Total earnings
• Progress to milestone bonus

100% transparent - you can verify everything on the blockchain too!
```

### If they're interested
```
Amazing! Here's how to join:

1. Go to https://squidway.io/elite/onboarding
2. Enter code: squider26
3. Fill out the quick application (2 min)
4. We'll verify within 24-48hrs
5. You'll get dashboard access + unique referral link

Any questions along the way, just DM me!

## Earnings Example (Use in Conversations)

```
Quick example:

If 100 of your followers each buy 2 tickets:
→ 200 tickets sold = 500 USDT earned
→ 100 active users = on track for 5K bonus
→ Plus 10% of any winnings they get!

At 500 active users:
→ ~1,000-1,500 tickets = 2,500-3,750 USDT
→ PLUS 5,000 USDT milestone bonus
→ Total: 7,500-8,750 USDT + ongoing earnings
```

---

## DO's and DON'Ts

### ✅ DO:
- Emphasize immediate commission (2.5 USDT per ticket)
- Present 5K bonus as achievable milestone, not barrier
- Show earnings examples to make it tangible
- Be transparent about "active user" definition
- Highlight dashboard tracking
- Mention ongoing passive income

### ❌ DON'T:
- Make it sound like they only earn if they hit 500 users
- Overemphasize the 5K at the expense of immediate commissions
- Promise they'll definitely hit 500 users (set realistic expectations)
- Hide the "active user" definition (1 ticket purchase minimum)
- Make unrealistic income claims
- Use pressure tactics

🏆 5K USDT at 500 active users

---

## Milestone Positioning Strategy

**Frame the 5K bonus as:**
- "Achievable goal" not "barrier to earnings"
- "Bonus reward" not "only way to make money"
- "Milestone celebration" not "minimum requirement"

**Good framing:**
- "Plus a 5K bonus when you hit 500 active users"
- "Reach 500 active users and unlock an extra 5K"
- "Milestone reward: 5,000 USDT at 500 users"

**Bad framing:**
- "You get 5K if you can bring 500 users" (sounds conditional)
- "5K for 500 users" (unclear if that's all they earn)
- "Earn up to 5K" (misleading - commission has no cap)

---

## Calculator for Influencer Conversations

**When they ask "What can I realistically earn?"**

```
Let's do some quick math based on your [follower count]:

Conservative estimate (1% conversion):
→ [100] followers buy tickets = [250] USDT/month
→ 5-10 months to hit 500 users = 5K bonus
→ Total first year: ~2,500 + 5,000 = 7,500 USDT

Optimistic estimate (3% conversion):
→ [300] followers buy tickets = [750] USDT/month
→ 2-3 months to hit 500 users = 5K bonus
→ Total first year: ~9,000 + 5,000 = 14,000 USDT

Plus ongoing passive income after that!
```

---

## Objection Handling

### "That seems like a lot of users to get"
```
I hear you! But remember:

1. You earn immediately - 2.5 USDT per ticket from day 1
2. Average SQUIDER gets 10-20 active users per month
3. With consistent promotion, 500 users is 2-4 months
4. If you don't hit it, you still keep all commissions

Think of the 5K as a nice bonus, not the main income source!
```

### "What if my audience isn't interested?"
```
Fair point! That's why there's no commitment.

If you promote it and get 50 active users, that's still:
→ ~100-150 tickets = 250-375 USDT earned
→ Plus 10% of any winnings they get
→ Zero cost to you to try

You can always stop if it's not resonating with your audience.
```

### "How long does the 5K bonus take to get?"
```
Varies by influencer size and engagement:

Micro (5-20K): Usually 3-6 months
Mid (20-100K): Usually 2-4 months  
Macro (100K+): Can be 1-2 months

But again - you're earning the whole time! The 5K is just the cherry on top when you hit the milestone.
